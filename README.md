ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

       Various Git commands use the following environment variables:

  GIT_INDEX_FILE
           This environment allows the specification of an alternate index
           file. If not specified, the default of $GIT_DIR/index is used.

       GIT_INDEX_VERSION
           This environment variable allows the specification of an index
           version for new repositories. It won't affect existing index files.
           By default index file version 2 or 3 is used. See git-update-
           index(1) for more information.

       GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment
           variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath -
           otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

       GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
           Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be
           archived into shared, read-only directories. This variable
           specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of Git
           object directories which can be used to search for Git objects. New
           objects will not be written to these directories.


   The Git Repository
       These environment variables apply to all core Git commands. Nb: it is
       worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above Git
       so take care if using a foreign front-end.

    GIT_INDEX_FILE
           This environment allows the specification of an alternate index
           file. If not specified, the default of $GIT_DIR/index is used.

       GIT_INDEX_VERSION
           This environment variable allows the specification of an index
           version for new repositories. It won't affect existing index files.
           By default index file version 2 or 3 is used. See git-update-
           index(1) for more information.

       GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment
           variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath -
           otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

       GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
           Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be
           archived into shared, read-only directories. This variable
           specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of Git
           object directories which can be used to search for Git objects. New
           objects will not be written to these directories.   


   other
       GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY
           A number controlling the amount of output shown by the recursive
           merge strategy. Overrides merge.verbosity. See git-merge(1)

       GIT_PAGER
           This environment variable overrides $PAGER. If it is set to an
           empty string or to the value "cat", Git will not launch a pager.
           See also the core.pager option in git-config(1).

       GIT_EDITOR
           This environment variable overrides $EDITOR and $VISUAL. It is used
           by several Git commands when, on interactive mode, an editor is to
           be launched. See also git-var(1) and the core.editor option in git-
           config(1).

       GIT_SSH, GIT_SSH_COMMAND
           If either of these environment variables is set then git fetch and
           git push will use the specified command instead of ssh when they
           need to connect to a remote system. The command will be given
           exactly two or four arguments: the username@host (or just host)
           from the URL and the shell command to execute on that remote
           system, optionally preceded by -p (literally) and the port from the
           URL when it specifies something other than the default SSH port.

           $GIT_SSH_COMMAND takes precedence over $GIT_SSH, and is interpreted
           by the shell, which allows additional arguments to be included.
           $GIT_SSH on the other hand must be just the path to a program
           (which can be a wrapper shell script, if additional arguments are
           needed).

           Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your
           personal .ssh/config file. Please consult your ssh documentation
           for further details.

       GIT_ASKPASS
           If this environment variable is set, then Git commands which need
           to acquire passwords or passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP
           authentication) will call this program with a suitable prompt as
           command-line argument and read the password from its STDOUT. See
           also the core.askPass option in git-config(1).

       GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT
           If this environment variable is set to 0, git will not prompt on
           the terminal (e.g., when asking for HTTP authentication).

       GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
           Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide
           $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig file. This environment variable can be used
           along with $HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME to create a predictable
           environment for a picky script, or you can set it temporarily to
           avoid using a buggy /etc/gitconfig file while waiting for someone
           with sufficient permissions to fix it.

       GIT_FLUSH
           If this environment variable is set to "1", then commands such as
           git blame (in incremental mode), git rev-list, git log, git
           check-attr and git check-ignore will force a flush of the output
           stream after each record have been flushed. If this variable is set
           to "0", the output of these commands will be done using completely
           buffered I/O. If this environment variable is not set, Git will
           choose buffered or record-oriented flushing based on whether stdout
           appears to be redirected to a file or not.

       GIT_TRACE
           Enables general trace messages, e.g. alias expansion, built-in
           command execution and external command execution.

           If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case
           insensitive), trace messages will be printed to stderr.

           If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2 and lower
           than 10 (strictly) then Git will interpret this value as an open
           file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into this
           file descriptor.

           Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path (starting
           with a / character), Git will interpret this as a file path and
           will try to write the trace messages into it.

           Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or "false"
           (case insensitive) disables trace messages.

       GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS
           Enables trace messages for all accesses to any packs. For each
           access, the pack file name and an offset in the pack is recorded.
           This may be helpful for troubleshooting some pack-related
           performance problems. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output
           options.

       GIT_TRACE_PACKET
           Enables trace messages for all packets coming in or out of a given
           program. This can help with debugging object negotiation or other
           protocol issues. Tracing is turned off at a packet starting with
           "PACK" (but see GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE below). See GIT_TRACE for
           available trace output options.

       GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE
           Enables tracing of packfiles sent or received by a given program.
           Unlike other trace output, this trace is verbatim: no headers, and
           no quoting of binary data. You almost certainly want to direct into
           a file (e.g., GIT_TRACE_PACKFILE=/tmp/my.pack) rather than
           displaying it on the terminal or mixing it with other trace output.

           Note that this is currently only implemented for the client side of
           clones and fetches.

       GIT_TRACE_PERFORMANCE
           Enables performance related trace messages, e.g. total execution
           time of each Git command. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output
           options.

       GIT_TRACE_SETUP
           Enables trace messages printing the .git, working tree and current
           working directory after Git has completed its setup phase. See
           GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

       GIT_TRACE_SHALLOW
           Enables trace messages that can help debugging fetching / cloning
           of shallow repositories. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output
           options.

       GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs
           literally, rather than as glob patterns. For example, running
           GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1 git log -- '*.c' will search for commits
           that touch the path *.c, not any paths that the glob *.c matches.
           You might want this if you are feeding literal paths to Git (e.g.,
           paths previously given to you by git ls-tree, --raw diff output,
           etc).

       GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as
           glob patterns (aka "glob" magic).

       GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as
           literal (aka "literal" magic).

       GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as
           case-insensitive.

       GIT_REFLOG_ACTION
           When a ref is updated, reflog entries are created to keep track of
           the reason why the ref was updated (which is typically the name of
           the high-level command that updated the ref), in addition to the
           old and new values of the ref. A scripted Porcelain command can use
           set_reflog_action helper function in git-sh-setup to set its name
           to this variable when it is invoked as the top level command by the
           end user, to be recorded in the body of the reflog.

       GIT_REF_PARANOIA
           If set to 1, include broken or badly named refs when iterating over
           lists of refs. In a normal, non-corrupted repository, this does
           nothing. However, enabling it may help git to detect and abort some
           operations in the presence of broken refs. Git sets this variable
           automatically when performing destructive operations like git-
           prune(1). You should not need to set it yourself unless you want to
           be paranoid about making sure an operation has touched every ref
           (e.g., because you are cloning a repository to make a backup).

       GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL
           If set, provide a colon-separated list of protocols which are
           allowed to be used with fetch/push/clone. This is useful to
           restrict recursive submodule initialization from an untrusted
           repository. Any protocol not mentioned will be disallowed (i.e.,
           this is a whitelist, not a blacklist). If the variable is not set
           at all, all protocols are enabled. The protocol names currently
           used by git are:

           ·   file: any local file-based path (including file:// URLs, or
               local paths)

           ·   git: the anonymous git protocol over a direct TCP connection
               (or proxy, if configured)

           ·   ssh: git over ssh (including host:path syntax, ssh://, etc).

           ·   http: git over http, both "smart http" and "dumb http". Note
               that this does not include https; if you want both, you should
               specify both as http:https.

           ·   any external helpers are named by their protocol (e.g., use hg
               to allow the git-remote-hg helper)
